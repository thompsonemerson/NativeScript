[NativeScript](http://www.nativescript.org) empowers you to access native APIs from JavaScript directly. The framework currently provides iOS and Android runtimes for rich mobile development and can be utilized in a number of diverse use cases.

## Getting Started and Installation

Our Getting Started Guides are hands-on tutorials that walk you through developing with NativeScript:

* [Get started with JavaScript](http://docs.nativescript.org/tutorial/chapter-0)
* [Get started with TypeScript and Angular](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/tutorial/ng-chapter-0)

## Contribute

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript.git
$ cd NativeScript

# setup workspace for development
$ npm run setup

# list all available commands to run
$ npm start
```
